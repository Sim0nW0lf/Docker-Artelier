# Installation

I recommend using [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) (can be installed) or [Hostgator.com](https://www.hostgator.com/help/article/how-to-test-the-upload-and-download-speed-of-your-server#why) (can be run as script) or both!

I provide the hostgator script here with python3, you might have to change the first line of the script depending on your python installation.

Just make the script executeable and run it:
```
chmod +x speedtest-cli
./speedtest-cli
```

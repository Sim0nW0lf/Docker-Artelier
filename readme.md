# Docker-Atelier

My goal is to install every app with one command.
docker-compose with Dockerfiles is really great already and for additional configurations I am writing scripts.

I hope you can profit from my automations, I surely do!

## Installation

* Install [Docker & Docker-Compose](https://github.com/Sim0nW0lf/Docker-Atelier/tree/master/1.%20Docker%20%26%20Docker-Compose)

* Install [Traefik](https://github.com/Sim0nW0lf/Docker-Atelier/tree/master/2.%20Traefik/_Installation)

* Install any other application from this Atelier

Every application folder can be renamed and copied where it should be installed. Then just enter the "_Installation" folder and execute setup.sh.
```
chmod +x setup.sh && sudo ./setup.sh
```

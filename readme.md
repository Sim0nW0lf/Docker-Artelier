# Docker-Atelier

My goal is to install every app with one command.
docker-compose with Dockerfiles is really great already and for additional configurations I am writing scripts.

I hope you can profit from my automations, I surely do!

## Installation

* Install Docker & Docker-Compose

* Install Traefik

* Install any other app from this Atelier
